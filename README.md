# Kalash Vimawala — Talabat-Style Resume 🧡

Hi there! 👋  

This is my resume, but with a twist: I’ve reimagined it in the style of [Talabat’s homepage](https://www.talabat.com/uae).  
Instead of plain text, my **skills, experience, volunteering, awards, and education** are showcased as if they were categories, restaurant cards, groceries, and promos. 🍕🥗🥳  

---

## ✨ Why this format?
Because product management is about **crafting experiences that delight users**.  
Just like Talabat makes ordering food seamless and engaging, I believe resumes can also be fun, interactive, and memorable.
